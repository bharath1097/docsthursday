_A Look Into Static Site Generators For Open Source Docs by Carolyn Stransky_ ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2hbcnEIqrA&t=20s)) 24m video

A review of 46 polled open source projects, from small home-grown to very large projects. Some key takeaways are most projects are concerned with conributor experinence, the community of the static site gen, and automation. Interesting was that language was not a preference but rather having a less steep learning curve was key. Most projects interviewed cited that they were happiest when using a variety of tools that fit their specific needs.
